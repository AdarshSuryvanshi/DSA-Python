"""
Function count_occurrences(n, arr):

This function takes two parameters: the digit n and the array arr.
It loops through each element in the array and checks if it matches the input digit.
If thereâ€™s a match, the count is incremented.
The function returns the final count after checking the whole array.
Main Part:

The user is prompted to input a digit.
A predefined array arr = [1, 3, 1, 2, 2, 5] is used for testing.
The function is called, and the result is displayed.
Example Output:


Enter the digit you want to check: 1
The digit 1 appeared 2 times in the array.
Explanation of Code Behavior:
The function efficiently counts how many times the user-provided digit appears in the array.
Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the array, because we traverse the array once.
