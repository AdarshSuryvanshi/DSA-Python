""" 
xplanation of the Two-Pointer Approach:
Use left pointer to track where the next non-zero should go.
Use right pointer to iterate through the array.
Swap non-zero elements to the front while maintaining the relative order.
Why is this approach efficient?
âœ… Time Complexity: O(n) (Single pass through the array)
âœ… Space Complexity: O(1) (Modifies array in place, no extra space)
âœ… Maintains Relative Order of non-zero elements

This is the most optimal way to move zeroes while keeping the relative order intact. ðŸš€
