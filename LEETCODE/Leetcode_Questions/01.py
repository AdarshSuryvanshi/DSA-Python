üöÄ Concept: Trie (Prefix Tree) + HashMap
 1) Trie Structure:
Each node stores a dictionary of child nodes for fast prefix searching.
Each node maintains a HashMap of sentence frequencies.

2) Efficient Searching:
On each character input, traverse the Trie to find matching sentences.
Sort results by frequency and ASCII order to return the top

3) Sentence Storage:
When a user types #, store the new sentence in the Trie.

üî• How the Code Works
Initialization:

The AutoCompleteSystem is initialized with past search data.
The _insert() function builds a Trie storing sentence frequencies.
Handling User Input (input(char c)):

If the input is #, the sentence is saved.
Otherwise, the system searches for sentences matching the prefix.
It returns the top 3 most frequent sentences in the correct order

üèÜ Time Complexity Analysis
Insertion (_insert()): 
O(L), where 
L is the sentence length.
Searching (_search_top_3()):
Traversing the Trie: 
O(L).
Sorting: 
O(NlogN) (for small N ‚â§ 102, sorting is negligible).

"""

### Example of Excution 
# Initialize autocomplete system
auto = AutoCompleteSystem(["i love you", "island", "ironman", "i love geeksforgeeks"], [5,3,2,2])

# User starts typing "i"
print(auto.input('i'))  # Output: ["i love you", "island", "i love geeksforgeeks"]

# User types space "i "
print(auto.input(' '))  # Output: ["i love you", "i love geeksforgeeks"]

# User types "a"
print(auto.input('a'))  # Output: []

# User completes input with '#'
print(auto.input('#'))  # Output: []

""" 
Why This Approach?
‚úÖ Optimized: Trie ensures quick prefix searching.
‚úÖ Sorted Output: Sorting by frequency and ASCII ensures correct results.
‚úÖ Handles New Inputs: Dynamically adds new sentences to the system.
